How was the workload divided I made this project by myself.

Technologies I used in this project HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML and CSS was familiar to me before from developing websites course. In this course we are studying Javascript, so it is new thing to me to learn.

Setup

Credits I used W3school, lecture materials and videos and copilot, because I didn't found out, how to get the movie length to show.
